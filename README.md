Some PHP functions for brightbearl's API
The aim of this is to help others attempting to integrate with Brightpearls API using PHP. I didn't find much resources online so this was pieced together and probably took longer than it should have. 
It will not work immediately - you'll need to enter your account details and have some data structure to get some info but the essentials are there.
Hopefully these functions will help you fill in some of the gaps in documentation.
Any problems please don't hesitate to let me know.
Thanks,
Al
